The idea with the app is to have a global watchlist while at the same time find new shows via community.

I purposely did not include a rating system, rather go by whats being said, what show has been recommended the most, and/or which
show is being watched (in watchlist) the most.

I played off of the words "Couch Potato" and called the recommendations "Hot Potatoes" like the childhood game
of passing a "potato" around!
